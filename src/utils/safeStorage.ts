// ─── safeStorage — the only safe way to touch Web Storage at module scope ───
//
// `window.localStorage` is not always an object with methods on it. Three
// distinct failure shapes, and they need three different guards:
//
//   1. **It can be `null`.** On YouTube Playables — which the Playgama archive
//      is submitted to — `window.localStorage` and `window.sessionStorage` are
//      `null`, not absent. This is the one that bites, because the idiomatic
//      guard does not catch it:
//
//          if (typeof localStorage === 'undefined') …   // WRONG: typeof null === 'object'
//
//      so a module-scope `localStorage.getItem('x')` throws
//      `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null` BEFORE `bootstrap()` runs,
//      and the whole game is a blank screen. Nothing later in the boot sequence
//      gets a chance to handle it. This exact bug rejected a 2026-09 submission.
//   2. **The accessor itself can throw.** Safari in Lockdown/private mode and
//      some embedded WebViews throw on `window.localStorage` access rather than
//      returning anything, so even reading the property needs a try.
//   3. **The methods can throw.** Quota exhaustion on write, and private-mode
//      quirks on read.
//
// A try/catch around an access handles all three, which is why the wrapped
// call sites elsewhere in this codebase (`useGameState.persistRaw`, the
// GameScene helpers) were already fine. What was NOT fine was the handful of
// UNGUARDED module-scope reads — those run at import time, before any error
// boundary exists. Route those through here.
//
// Returns `null` for "no value and no storage", which is the same answer
// `getItem` gives for a missing key — so callers that already handle a missing
// key need no new branch.
