// ─── UI modal-open signal ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Tracks how many blocking FModal dialogs (Upgrades, Options, Daily, Battle
// Pass, Achievements, …) are currently open, and HALTS THE SIMULATION while
// any of them is up.
//
// The pause is not cosmetic. Every one of these menus is opened mid-siege — the
// tech tree in particular is where the player goes to answer a wave that is
// beating them — and letting enemies keep chewing the tower while the player
// reads a menu punishes them for using the game's own systems. It also makes
// the CrazyGames contract honest: `gameplayStop()` is meant to mean gameplay
// actually stopped, not that a panel happens to be covering it.
//
// Two separate signals come out of this, deliberately:
//   * `isAnyModalOpen` — the SDK-event signal, consumed by the gameplay
//     lifecycle driver in `GameScene`.
//   * an app pause from `useGamePause` — the simulation + audio gate.
//
// Refcounted so overlapping / stacked modals compose: gameplay only resumes
// once the LAST modal closes. `acquireModalOpen()` returns a release function
// the caller (FModal) invokes on close / unmount.

// ─── Menus: the modals that are NOT the game ────────────────────────────────
//
// Every modal holds the simulation still, but not every modal takes the player
// out of the game. The settings are a menu. The rune-gift
// ceremony is a moment IN the storybook, and Poki's bracket stays open through
// it (owner, 2026-09-23). So a menu is counted apart, and a modal that is one
// says so by acquiring through here: it holds the same app pause and modal
// count as any other, plus this flag. Every FModal is a menu.
