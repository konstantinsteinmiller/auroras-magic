// ─── The portal analytics sink ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Split out of `useAnalytics.ts` for ONE reason: so the Playgama build can
// alias it away wholesale (`resolve.alias` in `vite.config.ts` →
// `analyticsSink.stub.ts`), the same mechanism as `pokiPlugin.stub.ts` and
// `yandexPlugin.stub.ts`.
//
// An `if (import.meta.env.VITE_APP_PLAYGAMA === 'true') return null` at the top
// of the probe was tried first and is NOT enough — measured, not assumed: the
// obfuscator's `stringArray` pass hoists literals into its indirection table
// before esbuild folds the env comparison, so `PokiSDK`, `GamePix`, `gtag` and
// `dataLayer` all still turned up in the Playgama archive with the guard in
// place. That archive is also the YouTube Playables submission, where another
// portal's SDK name and a Google Analytics entry point are exactly what a
// reviewer greps for, and nothing in the bundle says they are unreachable.
//
// Nothing here is Playables-specific otherwise; every other platform gets the
// real probe unchanged.
